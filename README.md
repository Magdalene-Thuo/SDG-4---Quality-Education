# SDG-4---Quality-Education
Goal: Identify student learning patterns using clustering to recommend personalized resources.  This targets unequal learning outcomes by understanding how students learn differently and guiding tailored support â€” a core issue in achieving Quality Education.
Problem Statement

âœ… ML Approach: Unsupervised Learning
Weâ€™ll use K-Means Clustering to:

Group students by behavior or performance.

Recommend learning materials suited to each cluster (e.g., visual vs. textual learners, fast vs. slow learners).

âœ… Dataset & Tools
ðŸ”¹ Datasets (Free & Open Source)
You can use:

Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)
Includes student demographics, course interactions, assessments.

Alternative:
Student Performance Data â€“ UCI/Kaggle

ðŸ”¹ Tools
Python, Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas, numpy (data handling)

scikit-learn (clustering)

matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)

âœ… Model Workflow
1. Preprocess Data
Handle missing values, encode categorical features.

Normalize/scale data.

2. Select Features
Variables like: study time, past grades, course activities, failures, absences.

3. Clustering
Use K-Means to segment students into learning profiles.

4. Visualize Clusters
Use PCA or t-SNE to reduce dimensions and plot clusters.
