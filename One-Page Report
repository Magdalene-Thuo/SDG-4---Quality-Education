*Title: Clustering Student Learning Profiles to Support Quality Education (SDG 4)*

Problem Statement:
We analyzed student performance to identify distinct learning profiles. This allows educators to personalize support and resources, helping students succeed based on their individual needs.

ML Approach:
We used Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering) to group students based on their academic performance and engagement metrics.

Results:
The model identified 3 core clusters:

Cluster 0: High performers

Cluster 1: Moderate performers

Cluster 2: At-risk students

These insights can be used to assign additional support (e.g., tutoring or alternative learning resources) to Cluster 2 students.

Ethical Considerations:

Avoid labeling students in ways that limit potential.

Data should be anonymized to protect student privacy.

Use insights to uplift, not penalize.
